# Tor-Socks
Dockerfile to build a Tor Socks5 proxy.

## Introduction
The Tor network is designed to provide anonymity to users, hiding their IP address and encrypting their network traffic. By using the SOCKS5 protocol, users can securely and anonymously connect to the Tor network, allowing them to access content that may be blocked in their region or that may be censored. Additionally, using the Tor network via SOCKS5 can also help protect users from hacker attacks and other security threats.
